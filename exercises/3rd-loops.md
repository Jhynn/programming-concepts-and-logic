# Repetition structuries ─ loops ─ exercises.

> I suggest that you use a `list` ─ if you need a collection and don't know 
> its values ─ and lists have a method called `append` ─ to call it, type: 
> `name_of_the_list.append(name_of_the_identifier_or_literal)`.

1. Develop a code which receives two values one for the begin and the another
one for the end of a range then print the odd numbers and the greater 
number of this range.

2. Receive numbers until the reported number is `0`. Then, print the 
arithmetic average of them.

3. Receive a number and report if it is prime or not.

4. Joseph has `1.5` meters of height and growing up `2cm` per year. 
Peter has `1.1m` and growing up `3cm` per year. Knowing this, report the year
which Peter will be more tall than Joseph.

5. Receive two numbers then report if one is a permutation of the another one.
_E.g._, `307` is a permutation of `703`; `9468` of `4689`.

> Remember that `str` is an iterable...

6. Receive a number then print the four arithmetic operations from `1` to 
`10` over it.

7. Receive n numbers until the entry is `0`, then inform if the numbers 
entered are either ordered (increasing or decreasing) or if they are random.

8. Receive a integer number then print the value defined like this: 
`(1/n) + (2/n-1) + (3/n-2) + (n/1)`.

9. A Pet Shop wishs to calculate the criation cost of hamsters, the cost is
defined by the formula: `(N*0.8)/2 + 10`.
Where N is the number of hamsters and the formula returns the cost in dollars.
Receive successive N values and calculate the respective costs. The program 
must stop when either a negative or zero value (_i.e._ a non-natural number) 
is provided.

10. A school wants to know the:
- older age among its students.
- younger age among its students.
- total male students.
- total female students.
<br/> Develop a code which receive the age and the genre (either `M` or `F`) of
a student then ask if the user want to record another student.

11. A company did a survey which about accepting your product and it wants to
know:
- How many women over 40 years old rated the product as good.
- How many women over 50 years old rated the product as good.
- How many men rated the product as unsatisfactory.
- Number of men who participated in the survey.
- Number of women who participated in the survey.

The data of the survey was stored like this:
- Age: integer number.
- Genre: _M_ for male, _F_ for female.
- Rate: 1-unsatisfactory 2-bad 3-regular 4-good 5-great.

> You will add participants by receiving their gender, age and rating 
> until you type _stop_. </br>
> I suggest that you use a `list` containing the mentioned features.

12. Receive two numbers, then calculate the power, being the first one the base 
and the other one the exponent ─ use the summation to get this value.

13. Code the Euclid's algorithm ─ Greatest Common Divisor.

14. Report the most long crescent series, _e.g._:
`7 15 16 1 30 29` _`14 15 22 37`_ the emphasized numbers show
that we have a sequence of `4` numbers growing.

15. Report how many numbers are equals in a sequence of `n` numbers.
_E.g._: `1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 9, 6, 6, 6, 7`. So `1, 1`; `5, 5, 5`;
`8, 8` and `6, 6, 6`. Hence, the result is `4`.

16. Every integer ─ `n` ─ raised to the 3rd power is equal to the sum of the 
odd numbers in the range 1 to `n`.
_E.g._: `3³ = 7 + 9 + 11`.

17. Report whether a number is perfect or not, _i.e._, if the sum of its
natural divisors is equal to it.

18. Receive a number in base 10, then print an equivalent number (in base 10) 
in base 2. _E.g._: `10 = 1010`.

19. Receives a number then display it in the iversed version. _E.g._: `17 = 71'.

20. Display every number which respect this fact: `√9801 = 98 + 01 = 99`. 
_I.e._, `9801 -> 98 01 -> 98 + 01 = 99 = √9801`.

21. Report whether a number is a palindrome or not. _E.g._: `373 = 373` 
(`True`); `173 = 371` (`False`).

22. Take the prices of 4 products in 2 supermarket, then report the better 
combination to use less money.

23. Calculate how old someone is, receive that person's birth date and the 
current date.
