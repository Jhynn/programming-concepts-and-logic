# Welcome to the Programming Concepts & Logic course

This course intends to teach people that ─ so far ─ do not program computers 
(in a formal and general way processor modules), so I really expect 
that you ─ _if is the case_ ─ learn to program with it.

In the final of each topic I let a list of exercises and their solutions, 
in order to you compare your solutions with mine.
